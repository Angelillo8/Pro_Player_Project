Pro Player - Interactive Football Player Application
Pro Player

Overview
Pro Player is an interactive application where users can create their own virtual football player and guide them through a season of matches. The objective is to improve the player's performance and stats by earning experience points (exp) after each match. Users can strategically upgrade their player's skills using the accumulated exp. Additionally, the project includes a dynamic league table that reflects the results of the user's team and other competing teams.

Earn Experience Points: After each match, your player earns experience points (exp) based on their performance.

Upgrade Player Skills: Strategically allocate earned exp to upgrade your player's skills, such as shooting, passing, and defending.
